de.js:
- Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.
- Node.js performs well, is written in JavaScript, has a rich package manager (npm), and is portable to various operating systems.

2. Creating a Simple Web Server with Node.js:
- Node.js can be used to create a simple web server using the Node HTTP package.
- By following the provided steps, you can create a basic web server that responds with "Hello World".

3. Web Frameworks and Express:
- Node.js alone is not sufficient for certain web development tasks that involve handling different HTTP verbs, serving static files, and using templates. This is where web frameworks like Express come in.
- Express is a popular Node web framework that provides mechanisms for routing, view rendering, setting application settings, and adding request processing middleware.

4. Express Ecosystem and Flexibility:
- Express has a vast ecosystem of compatible middleware packages that address various web development problems.
- However, finding the right packages can be a challenge due to the lack of a definitive structure for Express applications.

5. Node and Express Origins:
- Node.js was initially released in 2009, while Express was released in 2010. Both have evolved over time.
- Node.js has gained popularity due to its active community and support from major companies.

6. Popularity of Node and Express:
- Node and Express are popular frameworks with a large user base, active development, and ample resources.
- Express, in particular, is widely used by high profile companies and has a strong support network.

7. Express: An Unopinionated Framework:
- Express is an unopinionated framework, allowing developers to choose from a wide range of compatible middleware and structure their applications as desired.
- This flexibility can sometimes be overwhelming, but it enables developers to use the most suitable tools for their tasks.

8. Express Code and Functionality:
- Express provides methods for handling HTTP requests, specifying routes and views, and adding middleware.
- Developers can use any database mechanism supported by Node with Express.

9. Creating an Express Hello World example:
- Use the express module to create an Express application
- Define a route for the root path ('/') that returns 'Hello World!'

10. Importing and creating modules in Express:
- Modules can be imported using the require() function
- Create your own modules by exposing objects through module.exports

11. Using asynchronous APIs in Node.js:
- Node.js uses asynchronous APIs to handle time-consuming operations
- Callbacks are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations

12. Creating route handlers in Express:
- Define route handlers for different HTTP methods using the Express application object
- app.all() is a special routing method that handles all HTTP methods

13. Grouping route handlers in Express:
- Use express.Router object to group route handlers with a common route prefix
- This is useful for organizing routes in larger applications

14. Exporting the Router object:

15. To export the Router object in a route module, you can use the following code:
- const express = require("express"); const router = express.Router(); module.exports = router;

16. Adding routes to the Router:

17. To add routes to the Router object in the main app file, you can use the following code:
- const wiki = require("./wiki.js"); app.use("/wiki", wiki);

18. Working with middleware:
- Middleware functions are used in Express apps to perform operations on the request or response before calling the next function in the stack.
- Middleware functions can be added using app.use() for all routes and verbs, or for specific routes and verbs using app.get(), app.post(), etc.
- The order in which middleware functions are called is important, and they are called before setting routes.
- You can also write your own middleware functions, which have a third argument 'next' that must be called if the middleware function does not complete the request cycle.

19. Using third-party middleware:
- Third-party middleware can be installed using npm, for example: npm install morgan.
- To add third-party middleware to an Express app, you can use app.use() and pass the middleware function as an argument.

20. Serving static files:
- To serve static files in Express, you can use the express.static middleware.
- Static files can be served from a directory by adding the directory as an argument to express.static().
- You can use multiple express.static() calls to serve files from multiple directories.
- You can also create a virtual prefix for your static URLs by using app.use() with a mount path.

21. Handling errors:
- Errors in Express can be handled using special middleware functions that have four arguments: (err, req, res, next).
- You can create custom error handling middleware functions using app.use() or specify them for a specific route using app.get(), app.post(), etc.
- The default error handling middleware function provided by Express is added at the end of the middleware function stack.

22. Using databases:
- Express apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node.
- To use a specific database, you need to install the corresponding database driver using npm.
- In your Express code, you can require the driver, connect to the database, and perform CRUD operations.
- An example is shown for using MongoDB with the mongodb driver.

23. Accessing your database with an ORM:
- An ORM allows you to define your data as objects or models
- You can continue thinking in terms of JavaScript objects instead of database semantics

24. Rendering data with template engines:
- Template engines allow you to specify the structure of an output document
- Express supports multiple template engines for creating HTML and other types of documents

25. Setting up the template engine in Express:
- In your application settings code, you set the directory for templates
- You also set the view engine to use, such as 'some_template_engine_name'

26. File structure in Express:
- Express does not enforce a specific structure or component usage
- It is recommended to split your application into files based on function and problem domain

Working with express.js and Nodejs

1. What is Express.js?:
- Express.js is a Node.js web application server framework designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.
- It has become the standard server framework for Node.js and is the backend part of the MEAN stack.

1. Installing and using Express:
- Express can be installed via the Node Package Manager using the command 'npm install express'.
- It provides an easy way to handle multiple types of requests like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests.
- A simple 'Hello World' application can be created using Express.

1. What are Routes?:
- Routes determine the way in which an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint.
- Each route can have one or more handler functions, which are executed when the route is matched.
- The general syntax for a route is 'app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)', where METHOD is an HTTP request method (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE), PATH is a path on the server, and HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

1. Sample Web server using Express.js:
- Templates can be used in Node.js to create quick on-the-fly applications.
- Jade is a popular framework for templating in Node.js.
- Jade can be installed via the Node Package Manager.

1. Express Framework:
- Express is a popular framework used for developing Node.js applications.
- It is built on top of the Node.js framework and helps in fast-tracking development of server-based applications.

1. Routes:
- Routes are used to divert users to different parts of the web applications based on the request made.
- The response for each route can be varied depending on what needs to be shown to the user.

1. Templates:
- Templates can be used to inject content in an efficient manner.
- Jade is one of the most popular templating engines used in Node.js applications.
